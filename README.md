# ULTRA

ULTRA is a 2D fighting game in Unity. It's a lot like Street Fighter. I plan to release it for iOS, maybe also android if it isn't inconvenient.

Controls (planned, subject to change throughout development):

    - Press the arrow buttons on screen to walk left and right.

    - //Double tap the arrow buttons to run.

    - Swipe up to jump. You can move left and right while jumping.

    - Tap the screen while standing to attack, and keep tapping to do several combos. Whichever direction
    you tap relative to your character is the direction in which you'll attack. If they all hit, the first 
    three attacks will do light damage, and the fourth will be a "heavy attack" - see below. You don't need 
    to successfully hit the opponent to keep attacking.

    - Swipe in the direction that you're facing, or tap four times while standing to do a "heavy attack" - 
    if it hits, it'll do decent damage and send the enemy flying back.

    - //Tap the screen while jumping to attack similarly to how you would on the ground. You'll do four attacks, 
    just like if you were standing, except the fourth attack will be a "slam attack." 

    - //Swipe down while in mid-air to do a "slam attack" - if it hits, it'll do decent damage and send the 
    enemy down to the ground.   
 
    - Swipe down while standing to do an "upper attack" - if it hits, it'll do light damage and send the enemy 
    upward.

    - Swipe in the opposite direction that you're facing to roll backwards.
    
    - //Tap and hold with both thumbs while standing to block. In the first few frames (haven't decided how many),
    you're parrying - you will take a small fraction of damage from attacks, and you can't be disrupted by strong 
    attacks. After the first few frames, you're not parrying anymore. You take slightly more damage and can still 
    be knocked back or upwards. ULTRA attacks break blocks, but not parries. 

    - Press the ULTRA button to use your ULTRA attack. It can be a fast automatic combo, a super powerful single 
    attack, or something else. It depends on the character. You can only use it when your ULTRA bar fills up, which 
    happens when you get hit (and when you hit the enemy, to an extent).


I'll probably use existing sprites from random video game characters that I like to start.

This is a lot of stuff, so I might cut down during development or add things that I think would be cool. *Anything with a // in front of it is something that potentially will be cut or made more simple for time.* I figure I might as well aim high to start. I'll probably continue working after the due date if I cut things, because this seems like something I'd like to release. No online planned right now, but maybe someday.
